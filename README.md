# matfem - a MATlab Finite Element Method package

An object-oriented highly vectorized matlab package for solving finite element models. Only support 2D problems.

This package is a (object oriented & vectorized) reimplementation of my homework solution for a finite element class. The original homework solutions are in the `legacy` folder.

## Features

* Object oriented
* Highly vectorized
* Readable (following concepts used in finite element)
* Can solve coupled physical system (see `coupled.m` for example)

## Examples

All `.m` files in this root folder are example codes.
Need to write examples in matlab notebook format.

## ToDo List

- [ ] Add documentation for package code :scream:
- [ ] `.m` -> `.mlx`
